# About

This repository contains the specification for MapVer, a SemVer-like versioning system designed specifically for Counter-Strike 2 maps. MapVer aims to help mapmakers communicate the scale and impact of changes to their maps over time, benefiting both players and tournament organizers.

You can view the specification in [mapver.md](./mapver.md).

## Purpose

By following MapVer, mapmakers can clearly communicate the scale of changes to their maps, helping players and tournament organizers understand how significantly a map has evolved over time.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the MapVer specification. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your suggestions.

## Acknowledgments

MapVer is inspired by [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), adapted for the specific needs of Counter-Strike 2 map development.
